Hi, I'm Congyi Wang, currently working on the database kernel of [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) at @[RisingWaveLabs](https://github.com/risingwavelabs). My main focus is on storage and data lake solutions

I'm involved in the [OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/opendal) community, an Open Data Access Layer that enables seamless interaction with diverse storage services, and they promoted me as a committer.


Before joining RisingWave, I interned at Alibaba Cloud Object Storage(OSS) and ByteDance Commercialization, where I gained hands-on experience in cloud computing and data infrastructure.


I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Fudan University.
